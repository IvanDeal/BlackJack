     Version 1.5 of my Blackjack game. Base project complete. Things to imoprove/add/change in future versions
     1) Move objects into classes for easier management and tidyness
     2) Add visuals/graphics
     3) Game loop
     4) Add currency to wager?
     5) Extended blackjack rules such as splits and having a blackjack and an ace
     6) Ace is currently only worth 1, need to add option for 11
     7) I think there are also rules about minimum numbers to stick on.....16 maybe? Need to find those.
     8) Multiple players?
     9) Clean up inputs
